```html
<div class="flex w-full">
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200"></div>
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200"></div>
</div>
```
Adding `w-full` to the parent flex container explicitly sets its width to 100%, thus resolving the spacing issue by ensuring there is no unexpected space between the two elements.  Alternatively, you can use the `space-x-0` utility class on the parent to remove any default spacing between the flex items.  Choose the solution that best suits your overall layout needs.
